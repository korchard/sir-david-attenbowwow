        description: `This year I turned 2 and my paw-rents took me up the North Shore
        of Lake Superior to see the fall colors and hike. The lake was beautiful, and 
        also very chilly. There is something magical about this large lake that I look 
        forward to continuing to develop a relationship with it.`,

        Since then, anytime my paw-rents use the word "BWCA", I jump and talk and ask them 
        to take me back there. It was such a wild place and I hope to continue to enjoy 
        it every year from here out. We saw beavers, birds, turtles, and many other creatures. 
        The red squirrels and I were not friends.`,
