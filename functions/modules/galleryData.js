		description: `We went camping this summer on the St. Croix river. We went paddle 
		boarding, had a fire going, and made delicious food. My favorite thing to do is spend 
		days and days living outside with my favorite people. I sure get tuckered out though.`,

		description: `I found a baby turtle on the road when I was walking at the 
		cabin. He needed to be guided back towards the river to safety. I do my best to 
		be considerate, and remember that all my favorite places to be are also home 
		to a variety of creatures. We all live in the same ecosystem, so it's important 
		that we take care of each other.`,

		description: `This year I turned 2 and my paw-rents took me up the North Shore
        of Lake Superior to see the fall colors and hike. The lake was beautiful, and 
        also very chilly. There is something magical about this large lake, and I look 
        forward to continuing to develop a relationship with it.`,

		description: `I took my first trip to the Boundary Waters this year. I thrived! 
        Since then, anytime my paw-rents use the word "BWCA", I jump and talk and ask them 
        to take me back there. It was such a wild place and I hope to continue to enjoy 
        it every year from here out. We saw beavers, birds, turtles, and many other creatures. 
        The red squirrels and I were not friends.`,

        Middle Eau Claire Lake in Northern Wisconson. This lake has been cared 
        for diligently by the DNR. They have eradicated invasive species and taken 
        measures to ensure the ecosystem of the lake remains healthy. It's my favorite 
        swimming spot.`,

		description: `We hiked a few different places while visiting Sedona. My 
        paw-rents call me a Billy Goat, as I like to scurry up the rocks without 
        any hesitation. This picture was taken hiking Cathedral Rock, which was a bit 
        steep and I needed to ride in the backpack. Cathedral Rock is said to be a 
		vortex, I sure felt it.`,

		pretty happy about this.`,

		and sunset were truly magical.`,

        me for a few days. We visited the Trego Nature Trail along the Namekagon 
        River. There is much protected forest in this area near the cabin. I love being 
		able to frollick around the landscape and I love my grand-paw-rents! They spoil me.`,

        snow and face diving into snow piles. My paw-rents like to get outside 
        often during the winter months, it helps all of us to be able to be outside all 
		year round. Here we are walking through the North woods in Minnesota.`,
