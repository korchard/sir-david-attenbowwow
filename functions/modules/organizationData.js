		description: `Northeastern Minnesotans for Wilderness (NMW), which leads the 
        Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, was formed in 1996 to continue working 
        to protect the Boundary Waters and other wild places against ever-increasing 
        public and commercial pressures so that the area’s wild character remains intact 
        for future generations. In September 2013, the national coalition, called 
        the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, was formed to create a national 
        movement to protect the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining. 
        It is led and funded by NMW. Today, NMW is the largest conservation organization 
        in Minnesota that focuses on protecting and preserving the Boundary Waters and 
        greater Quetico-Superior region.`,
